ABSTRACT="In this paper a general purpose `FPGA cluster' based distributed framework
for high-performance Computing has been proposed. Such a set-up finds its
usage in cryptanalysis applications. The framework abstract crypto kernels
(compute modules) implemented over an underlying networked FPGA cluster,
for the host's user-space cryptanalytic applications. Issues related to the
kernel (crypto compute module) management and efficient distribution of the
network bandwidth between the inter-FPGA and intra-FPGA kernels have been
covered. 40-bit partial key attack over AES256 has been demonstrated as a
capability demonstration. Performance higher than clustered CPUs and GPUs
at lower costs and power is reported."

ABSTRACT="In this paper we propose a development framework based on MyHDL (Python
based library) for developing high performance computing (Crypt-analysis
Applications) over an FPGA Cluster (fhpclib). The development framework
gives Python based high-level abstraction to the HDL development life-cycle
for the FPGA based Cluster setup. High level programming language gives an
opportunity for faster pre synthesis functional analysis and also provide
rigorous testing approaches like unittests for better closures and error
free designs.
